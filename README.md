# OpenGL
Practicing OpenGL


I did not have any thoughts about sharing codes when I started learning OpenGL.Therefore the project wont build due to linking errors of third party libraries.
I decided to keep them for further use as a reference point.

##### I learned OpenGL from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) and [Cherno's OpenGL playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2).Codes are mixed from those sources.
